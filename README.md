JDSkye Solutions — SEO notes

- Primary domain: jdskyesolutions.com
- Added meta tags (title, description, keywords, author, robots)
- Added Open Graph and Twitter Card meta tags for rich previews
- Added JSON-LD structured data for `ProfessionalService`
- Added `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt`

Deployment notes:

- Ensure the site is served from https://jdskyesolutions.com so canonical and sitemap URLs match.
- Submit `https://jdskyesolutions.com/sitemap.xml` to Google Search Console and Bing Webmaster Tools.
- Verify `og:image` and favicon paths are reachable; replace the image URL if hosting path differs.

New pages added:

- `/services/orange-county.html` — Mobile Notary Orange County
- `/services/los-angeles.html` — Mobile Notary Los Angeles
- `/services/san-diego.html` — Mobile Notary San Diego
- `/services/riverside.html` — Mobile Notary Riverside

These pages are intentionally not linked in the main navigation (hidden) but are included in `sitemap.xml` to boost local relevance for search queries.
